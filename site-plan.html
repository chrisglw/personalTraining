        <p>Hi, my name is Christian. I am an online and in person fitness trainer.
        </p>
        <p>I began my fitness journey during my teenage years when I felt dissatisfied
            with my physique. Upon graduating high school, I eagerly stepped into the 
            gym world, igniting a fervor for intense weight training.
        </p>
        <p>Ever since, I've been captivated by the process of transformation, 
            both physically and mentally. I firmly believe in the potential within 
            each of us to evolve into our best selves. My mission is to inspire 
            and motivate others, showing them that remarkable change is achievable.
        </p>
        <p>Starting out without a coach, I relied heavily on self-education, 
            devouring countless YouTube videos. Along the way, I encountered setbacks 
            and injuries, which fueled my determination to delve deeper into fitness 
            research. Over the past seven years, I've dedicated myself to studying 
            optimal workout techniques and nutrition strategies, 
            supplemented by coursework in nutrition and fitness during my college years.
        </p>
        <p>I did not have a trainer when I started, so I spent a lot of time watching 
            YouTube videos. I have had many injuries in the process, so I have spent 
            the last 5 years researching fitness, and better ways to work out and eat.
            I also took some nutrition, and fitness classes in College. 
        </p>
        <p>Let me help you save you all that time, and injuries by sharing my 
            knowledge with you, so that you can start your
            fitness journey.
        </p>
      </ul>
