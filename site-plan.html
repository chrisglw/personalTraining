      <p>Hi, my name is Christian Landaverde. I am an online and in person fitness coach and trainer.</p>
      <p>I began my fitness journey during my teenage years in high school because I was really skinny.
        I got a gym membership at the age of 18 when I graduated high school, and as time went on, I started to
        have a passion for intense weight training.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have always enjoyed the process of physically and mentally changing for the better.
        I believe everyone is capable of becoming the best version of themselves, so I want to spread inspiration
        and motivation to many, to show them that it is possible!</p>
      <p>I did not have a trainer when I started, so I spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos. I have had many injuries
        in the process, so I have spent the last 5 years researching fitness, and better ways to work out and eat.
        I also took some nutrition, and fitness classes in College. </p>
      <p>Let me help you save you all that time, and injuries by sharing my knowledge with you, so that you can start your
        fitness journey.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Programs</h3>
      <h4>Online</h4>
      <p>
        My online program is designed so that you can work out from anywhere in the world whether you decide to work
        at home or at the gym.</p>
      <p>Once you sign up, I am going to schedule a zoom call with you, so I can design your fully customized workout and nutrition plan.</p>
      <p>Go ahead and sign up now, so that we can start with your transformation to become the best version of yourself!</p>
      
      <h4>In Person</h4>
      <p>Have you thought about going to the gym, but you feel intimidated because you do not really know what you are doing?</p>
      <p>Do not worry! You can schedule an in person session with me, and I will be next to you during the whole workout session.
      I will be personally showing you how to execute the exercises step by step, counting your repetitions, and checking the 
      rest time.</p>
      <p>I'll be in touch with you within 2 - 3 business days to schedule an 1 on 1 in person training session.</p>
